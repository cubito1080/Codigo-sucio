# Asymptotic notation:

The notations we use to describe the asymptotic running time of an algorithm
are defined in terms of functions whose domains are the set of natural numbers
N = {0, 1, 2,...}. Such notations are convenient for describing the worst-case
running-time function T (n), which is usually defined only on integer input sizes.


It is sometimes convenient, however, to abuse asymptotic notation in a variety of ways. For example, the notation is easily extended to the domain of real numbers
or, alternatively, restricted to a subset of the natural numbers. **It is important**, however, to understand the precise meaning of the notation so that when it is abused, it
is not misused. This section defines the basic asymptotic notations and also introduces some common abuses.
